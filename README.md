# Final Project (Data-Driven Infographic: Boba Shop Trends)

## Purpose of this project

This project explores long-term trends in new boba (bubble tea) shop openings in the United States using business listing data from the Yelp Open Dataset. The primary goal is to design a data-driven infographic that communicates whether the number of new boba shops appearing in Yelp records has increased, declined, or stabilized over time, and how these patterns vary geographically.

This repository contains all code, documentation, and design materials for the final project in EDS 240. The project emphasizes thoughtful data wrangling, effective and accessible visualization design using {`ggplot2`}, and responsible communication of results, including clear discussion of data limitations and platform bias. The full assignment description can be found on the [course website](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/assignments/final-project.html).

## Data Access

This project uses publicly available business listing data from Yelp and will be stored locally due to the size.

#### Yelp Open Dataset

The Yelp Open Dataset contains information on businesses listed on Yelp, including business categories, location (city, state, latitude, longitude), review counts, ratings, and indicators of whether a business is currently open. While the dataset does not include a definitive business opening date, temporal information from reviews and business activity can be used to approximate when businesses first appear on the platform.
